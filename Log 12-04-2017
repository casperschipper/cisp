Rethinking the delay stream:
- Delay stream that is outside of time, the writer stream is synchronized with the reader stream
- A delay is simply a combined writer and reader stream, where the delay time is the offset.
- A filter is a certain process of the past.
- An offset

Fixed the depth and added a copy function, it is called replace and replacef
This allows you to replace an array that is embedded in another stream, for example

[10.0,11,12] @=> float foo[];

st.seq(foo).test();

1::second => now;

// you now use this
[101.0,102,103] @=> float bar[];
cs.replacef(bar,foo);
// SO NOT: bar @=> foo; this doesn't work.

// st.seq will now print bar values.
