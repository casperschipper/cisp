# CISP

Cisp is my attempt to create a live coding language for non-standard synthesis and algorithmic composition.
It's basic model of music is that of a stream. Inspired by examples as SSP and comp-scheme, the most basic approach to generating music, is that it is an amplitude changing over time.

Stepgen 

In cisp this is expressed as 
(step-gen (seq -1 1) (st 100))

Step gen is a generator that 
This will generate a square wave.
